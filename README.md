# ♟️ Chess Game

A fully interactive 2-player Chess Game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This project simulates a standard chess game, allowing users to select, move, and capture pieces according to official rules, including castling and turn management. It's a great example of DOM manipulation, game logic, and user interface design without using any external game engine.
